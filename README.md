## Overview:
This project aims to promote Indonesia's diverse tourist spots by developing a deep learning-based model for automatic detection and identification of tourist locations from images. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the model classifies various tourist attractions to make lesser-known sites more accessible to tourists.

## Problem Statement:
- How to identify tourist spots from photos without descriptions?
- How to promote Indonesia's natural beauty effectively?

## Objectives:
- Develop a deep learning model to identify and classify tourist attractions from images.
- Enhance the visibility of less popular tourist spots through technology.

## Methodology:
1. **Dataset Collection:** A dataset of 4256 images representing 30 classes of tourist attractions was used.
2. **Data Augmentation:** Various augmentations were applied, including horizontal flip, Gaussian blur, and color grading adjustments.
3. **Model Training:** Different CNN architectures, including VGG16 and ResNet, were trained with and without pre-trained weights on datasets like Place365 and ImageNet.

## Results:
- The highest validation accuracy (90%) was achieved using the VGG16 model pre-trained on Place365 with data augmentation.
- Models without data augmentation generally had lower validation accuracies.

## Conclusion:
The CNN-based model shows promising results for classifying Indonesian tourist spots, particularly when using pre-trained models and data augmentation. Future improvements can focus on increasing the model's ability to generalize features from the dataset.

## Contributions:
This project contributes to promoting Indonesia's tourism by leveraging advanced image classification techniques to highlight lesser-known attractions.
